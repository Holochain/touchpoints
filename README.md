Holochain App: P2P NFC interaction/event logging system which triggers actions and interfaces


Tap your phone against an NFC sticker. It could trigger an action like unlocking a door, or pop up a form with some information for you to complete.

This system runs on holochain as a fully P2P NFC (Near Field Communication) app. You write to your local hash chain, and then publish pubic events to the DHT.

This project came out of a hackathon sponsored by Just One Organics in Jan 2018.based 

Uses React/Redux for UI layer.
